# Icon Placeholder Information

Since I cannot directly save image files, you need to:

## Option 1: Save Your Rocket Icon (Recommended)
1. Save the countdown rocket icon image you showed me as:
   `assets/icon/app_icon.png`
2. Make it 1024x1024 pixels
3. PNG format with transparent background

## Option 2: Use a Temporary Icon
For testing purposes, you can create a simple colored square icon:
1. Create a 1024x1024 PNG image
2. Fill it with the app's primary color (#0A1E4D - dark blue)
3. Add text "Countdown" in the center
4. Save as `assets/icon/app_icon.png`

## Online Icon Generators
You can also use online tools:

After creating/saving the icon, run:
```bash
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
```
